# Vitejs - Differences between import statements and fetch/http requests within the public/ and src/ contexts.

While making my portfolio website, I realized that I needed a way to properly manage my data. I wanted to be able to easily create and change content for it without having the re-bundle and re-deploy my web application. It was while looking for answers to this problem that I got trapped in this little rabbithole of `import`/`fetch` and the correct usage of `public/`, `src/` and `src/assets/`, all within a Vitejs context.

So please, grab a seat and accompany me as we discuss all of these different concepts and how they all affect one another.

## **Import statements:**
When importing, what you are doing is telling Vitejs "Hey, get me this or that resource here" (now, depending on the format and plugins you might have, the how you get the content there and what exacly you end up getting differs, but that doesnt really matter to us, and if you want to have a mental image of this, we can assume we get it by basically copying the data from |source| and pasting it on |destination|).

Within a Vitejs application, **all import statements are resolved at bundling**, the browser does not handle those, nor the server. Vitejs handles them all.

If you were to be using vanilla JS/CSS/HTML and no bundler, and you happened to have an `import` statement inside your JS file. The browser would see that when first running the code after downloading it (this is another topic altogether) and inmediately ask the server for it. Meaning that **you would initiate a fetch request for each of those import statements**. But bundlers like Vitejs "bundle" things so that the initial request to your JS file already contains all needed code.

**What bundling does** is to rename all variables and re-organize and mix files together in order to create the most compact and efficient package possible.

So, within a Vitejs context, using an `import` statement means no fetching. You can check this if you build your application and run your built code:

```
npm run build --> build the web app
npm run preview --> serve the build
```

After that, go to the Network tab in your browser's dev tools, and check if you see any http request for your `import` statements. You will find none, because the code the host is serving is an already bundled code, and all `import` statements have already been resolved.

Funily enough, you can also check the opposite if you run the dev code and not the production/bundled code. If you do that you will in fact be able to see fetch requests for each of your `import` statements because you will be running un-optimized code; code that has been transpiled to vanilla JS/CSS/HTML but not optimized, which gets to show you an example of how would a traditional/un-bundled JS file run on a client.

To run your project un-optimized:

```
npm run dev --> runs un-optimized code
```

## **Bundling, import statements, project structure and data:**
Now lets try to understand what all of these means for your project structure and data management for a moment.

Vitejs bundles the code that is in the `src/` directory by changing names, locations and files all around. This means that you cannot really add to it in any way after that because you have no way of referencing anything in there anymore.

But, that is not the full picture isnt it? What if you are importing from outside the `src/` directory? You can do that after all... Well, in that case Vitejs will get the data from wherever you are pointing at with that `import` statement, meaning it will **COPY** it onto where the `import` statement is located (which is a file inside the `src/` directory somewhere) and then bundle it. Do you see what that means? It means that once you do that, if you change wathever file you where importing originally, it will have on effect at all because Vitejs already solved its import problem and already bundled the code, the browser will not import that file on its own either because the bundled code will contain no `import` statements when being sent to the browser.

So, if we cannot really use `import` for content that we want to change frequently, or add to, or do anything with. Then what can we do...

Fetch.

Now, before moving on to fetch, two things: a mention of `src/assets/` and a really cool way of thinking about bundling that I just came up with, youre gonna love it, believe me.

Contrary to what it sounds like, **data** inside the `src/` directory is not uncommon, there is a special folder for it actually, its the `src/assets/` directory. But that is not the place for data that is prompt to edits for the aforementioned reasons. That is the place for data **that you absolutely need to be sent to the client on the initial request, and that you know you wont need to change.**

Now onto the cool bundling analogy:

You can think of bundling as compiling but to the browser/V5 engine. Instead of going from source code on a language to machine code for a speciffic CPU architecture/intruction set, you go from JSX/Typescript kind of sugar to good ol' Javascript/HTML/CSS. In this analogy, `Importing` is just like **static** linking, once you link it is done, it stays there, is part of the binary.

## Fetch time:
Fetching is basically you requesting some data at runtime, asynchronously (I imagine you can do http requests synchronously, but only weirdos do that and the fetch API does it async anyways).

So what does it mean "requesting data at runtime"? It means requesting data as your code is executing, live. Which means, if you think about it, that the browser is the one dealing with it, not Vitejs, not the server (initially), the client's browser.

Since the browser is dealing with it, the path that we need to provide for the file we want to request must be accessible post-bundling, which means that you cannot fetch onto anything inside the `src/` directory... (because fetching happens at runtime, which only happens when you execute code, which means you are running it on the client because that's what runs the web app code, which means you already bundled and deployed your web app onto your server, which means your `src/` directory is a mess of random files and theres no way you can reference anything in there). And that is where the `public/` directory comes in. That's the place to store stuff that you want to fetch (by now you know, you can also store in there stuff that you want to import but the standard for that is `src/assets/` so you probably shouldn't do it)

So now you know where to store all your edit-sensitive data (`public/`), and how to get it (`fetch`), and also how `import` works, what `src/` and `src/assets/` are used for, what bundling does and how it affects your project structure and how all that must be understood in order to know how to handle data of all kinds; edit-sensitive, static data, wathever data, you name it.

Now onto some excersices and after that a small "Trivia and tips" to wrap it all up.

### **Dos and donts (plus the whys)**
Just to cement a bit all that content, lets go over some dos and donts and explain their whys.


- **Fetching a file that lives in the src/ directory:**
    - **DONT** (Impossible anyways)
    - **WHY:** Fetching occurs at runtime, which means your code has already undergone bundling by that point, so there's no way you can ever reference anything in there. But if you are still interested, my tests returned an error message in the form of html text.

- **Fetching a file that lives in the public/ directory:**
    - **DO** (As far as I know, its common practice)
    - **WHY:** Files in the `public/` directory are not subject to Vitejs bunlding process. Their names, location and their content will always remain the same, so you know where they will be at all times.

- **Importing a file that lives in the src/ directory:**
    - **DO** (As far as I know, its common practice)
    - **WHY:** Importing is resolved at bundling (right before the code mixing begins), so you can definitely import things from the `src/` directory since Vitejs will know how to find those.

- **Importing a file that lives in the public/ directory:**
    - **DO(NT)** (Not expected or common by what I can gather)
    - **WHY:** Is not like you can't, but people usually use the `src/` directory to store files that they want to use the `import` statement on, or the `src/assets/` directory for static data they want to `import` on. Maybe this is a grey area, who knows.


### Some tips and trivia
- If you `import` from the `public/` directory on a dev build it will work as it should. Now you will also notice that any changes you make to that import file will get reflected on the page next time you refresh, but do not get deceived by that:
    - The reason you always see the changes on refresh is because you are running the dev code, **you need to think of each refresh as a new bundling** when dealing with dev code.
    - Try doing the same with production code and you will see not changes will reflect. So, being in the `public/` directory is not enough, you need to know what `import` does in a Vitejs context.
- Fetching onto the `src/` directory will return you a 404 in dev mode, but it will actually return you a 200 OK in production mode. The content? some html text with an error message explaining that the file you are looking for cannot be found:
```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot GET /src_file.json</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

.
