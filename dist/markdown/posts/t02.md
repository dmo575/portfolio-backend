## **I/O 101**
While making the back-end for my portfolio on Deno I came across some input and output tasks, so I took that moment as an opportunity to hammer down a bit my understanding on how all of that worked by writing about it. This is the text.

### **What is I/O (Input and Output)**
Input and output both refer to the direction of data coming from or out of your application. Input is used whenever your app takes in data from somewhere, output is used for whenever your app send data somewhere else.

On this doc I'll focus on I/O operations when dealing with files specifically. Ill try to expand it in the future with some Web Socket I/O.

You will also notice that this document doesn't talk about API specifics. It just talks about how generally things work, but we wont adhere to any language's syntax.

### **I/O entities**
- **Input devices** are those that allow us to get data from them. Good examples are a Keyboard, a mouse or a mic.
These devices are usually characterized by the fact that they are specialized on transmutating data, usually from the physical medium onto the digital one (a mic records, etc) and then send it somewhere for further processing. This is important to know because it informs you about the nature of the data you are accessing (live data)

- **Output devices** are those you usually just send data to, like a monitor or speakers.
These devices are usually characterized by the fact that they are consumers of the data they receive. They don't store it, but rather they make instant use of it.

- **Input AND output entities:** These are more complex entities like a File, a web socket, or even your computer's memory.

That being said, lets walk trough the process of obtaining data from a file on the hard disk; an input operation.

## **Getting data from a file**
When we want to get data from a file on our HDD/SDD, we start by creating a "data stream" object. This data stream instance serves as a link from the file in the HDD/SSD to our application. This stream will deliver the data to us when we ask for it, which at first glance seems weird, why do we have this stream API in between us and a simple file? To answer that, lets consider this scenario:

***
Imagine we have a file that is 10GB long. If we ask for that file and the OS just gives that to us, it means our RAM will have to allocate memory for 10GB of continuous space all of a sudden just to fit in one single file. Not only that but also computing power will be necessary in order for the PC to write all of those 10GB of data from the disk onto the RAM. Can you imagine stopping all processes until you are done loading 10GB of RAM? (assuming its not multi-threaded code). that's a no-no in user-experience-land. So, instead of that we have this concept of data streams, which act as these tunnels that connect the data in the disk with your application.
***

The way data streams work is by allowing you to ask them for X amount of data. When you do that the data stream object will "fetch", if you will, that amount of data from the file and send it to you in order, after which it will keep track of how much data you asked it for, so that next time you ask for more it can continue serving you data from where it left off last time.

This means that if a file contains these bytes of data:

**AF 2B 3C 45 CV**

And you ask for 2 bytes (bytes are the standard units), you will get:

**AF 2B**

Then, the next time you ask, you will get:

**3C 45**

And the pattern will continue until the data stream reaches the end of the file (known as EOF), at which point it will return NULL or EOF, or something along those lines depending on your API.

So if you think about this, you can already solve both of those problems we mentioned earlier (RAM size crisis and taking the CPU hostage) by using this data stream concept:

***
Imagine you are displaying a movie; that is easily 10GBs of data or more. By using streams, you could ask for one image at a time, display it, then ask for the next one and do that for the whole 10Gb. If you do that your smart TV with a USB connector doesn't need to have 10/20/30GBs of RAM to play a movie, let alone load it. 512MB are more than enough for any movie stored on your USB, no matter its length.
***

### **Buffers**
Now lets add buffers into the mix.

A buffer is simply a continuous space in memory that you have allocated to put some data in... That's it. Buffers come into play because usually when you are asking the stream for X or Y amount of data, the way you do it is by passing a buffer to the stream to fill with data, so the size of the buffer determines the amount of data you are asking for.

Now while the definition of a buffer is as simple as that, the use cases are something completely different and out of the scope for what I'm trying to do right now, but do keep that in mind.

### **Read, write, append**
Sometimes you want to edit a file, not just read its contents. For that you can use File modes.

Files modes are something that you must specify when creating a data string on a file because it affects the stream you get back and the permissions the OS gives you in relation to that file you want to access. Lets go over the three most common files modes:

- **Read:** If you want to be able to read a file, you need to set its "read" file mode to true.
- **Write:** If you want to be able to write onto a file, you set the "write" file mode to true.

    Usually this means overriding the file's content. Meaning if your file contains the sentence "Hello World" and you write "Bye" onto it, your file contents will end up to be these: "Byelo World"

- **Append:** If you want to be able to add onto a file, you set the "append" file mode to true. Usually this means being able to write, starting at the end of the file, which means no overriding.

Depending on what you are using, you might be able to combine these modes (for example, read and write). This is all very API specific but the fact that there are file modes and they change what you can and cannot do with the data stream should be true for all languages and I/O libraries.

### **Closing the stream**
A data stream is a connection between the file and your application. You must remember to close it after you are done with it to avoid corrupting your file or not applying your changes to it. This is what is known as closing the file.


### **Serialization**
Whenever you want to save something onto a file, if its something complex you will have to serialize it before sending it up the stream. The reason is because files only store binary (because that's what the HDD/SDD disks store and what the computers work with).

Usually if you pass in text, it should be automatically converted into binary for you (because one character is usually one byte). But don't expect that same behavior when trying to pass in object structures or the like. For those you need to serialize the data before saving it and to deserialize it after retrieving it.

**But what is serializing anyways?, I hear you ask:** Serializing is converting a data structure into a string or a binary stream. If you are familiar with parsing, you can imagine they are the same thing. Something that serializes is something that parses down wathever it says it can serialize onto a string/binary **and back** (de-serializing).

Since data is always saved as binary, when you get it from a file you need to know how to deserialize it to something useful to you.

- When you know the data type and structure, you use an appropriate API that can deserialize the data.

- When you don't, you can only guess because there are no standard headers that all files must follow. However, files usually do have headers, so if you know how a .jpeg header looks like in bytes then you can peek on the file and compare. If it matches you can go ahead an try to deserialize it as a .jpeg and see if it works, just don't override the file while messing with it and you can try as many deserializers as you want.
