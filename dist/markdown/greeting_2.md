I got introduced to programming while doing my BFA in Game Development (focus on design) in the form of C# scripts for the Unity3D engine and immediately fell in love with it.

After graduating I started working at a game company as a Loc Tester with the initial idea of grinding my way up to the design team but instead of that, I started studying programming after work.

I did that for over half a year before deciding that I wanted to pursue this path full time.
