My final project for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/).

- **$$$Chatroom**: all users have access to a global live chatroom where they can participate (socketIO)
- Registering and logging in/out (username and password, no email)
- Restricted access to the web-page unless logged in
- Ability to search movies and series (trough the imdb API)
- Instant search results for searching your collection (AJAX)
- Wrote both back-end and front-end
- Keep track of movies per user **and** collections in an efficient way
- Users can assign movies to various collections and filter them out later
- Placeholder images while fetching from the API
