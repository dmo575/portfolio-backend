2D/2.5D Game Engine in C++

The Linux version of a game engine I made in C++ with SDL.

- Particle system with own managed pool
- Resource files automatically managed
- 2D Collision with visual debugger
- Logging system (This helped me a lot when converting my project to Linux)
- Different event systems (one triggers handlers instantly, other waits for EOF)
- You can render 3D shapes
- Much, much more...
