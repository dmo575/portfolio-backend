addictive calculator mini-game made in plain JS/CSS/HTML.

- **$$$Global leader-board** that displays not only username and score but country flag too!
- Interacts with several APIs:
    - **ipinfo.io** (*server-side*) : for info on the client's **direct** IP 
    - **flagsapi.com** (*client-side*) : for fetching country flags based on a country code
    - **Custom API** made on the back-end to update and retrieve leader-board data
- Adaptive design, works on both PC and mobile screens (portrait and landscape)
- Makes heavy use of ES6 promises and other JS asynchronous functions
- I manage **$$$my own database** for the leader-board with SQLite
- Wrote both the back-end and front-end, including server renting and set up
